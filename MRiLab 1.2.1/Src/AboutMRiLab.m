% Numerical MRI Simulation Package
% Version 1.2  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrilab/
%
% The MRiLab is a numerical MRI simulation package. It has been developed to 
% simulate factors that affect MR signal formation, acquisition and image 
% reconstruction. The simulation package features highly interactive graphic 
% user interface for various simulation purposes. MRiLab provides several 
% toolboxes for MR researchers to analyze RF pulse, design MR sequence, 
% configure multiple transmitting and receiving coils, investigate B0 
% in-homogeneity and object motion sensitivity et.al. The main simulation 
% platform combined with these toolboxes can be applied for customizing 
% various virtual MR experiments which can serve as a prior stage for 
% prototyping and testing new MR technique and application.

function varargout = AboutMRiLab(varargin)
% ABOUTMRILAB MATLAB code for AboutMRiLab.fig
%      ABOUTMRILAB, by itself, creates a new ABOUTMRILAB or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = ABOUTMRILAB returns the handle to a new ABOUTMRILAB or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      ABOUTMRILAB('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in ABOUTMRILAB.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      ABOUTMRILAB('Property','Value',...) creates a new ABOUTMRILAB or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before AboutMRiLab_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to AboutMRiLab_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
