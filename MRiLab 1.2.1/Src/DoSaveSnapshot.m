% Numerical MRI Simulation Package
% Version 1.2  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrilab/
%
% The MRiLab is a numerical MRI simulation package. It has been developed to 
% simulate factors that affect MR signal formation, acquisition and image 
% reconstruction. The simulation package features highly interactive graphic 
% user interface for various simulation purposes. MRiLab provides several 
% toolboxes for MR researchers to analyze RF pulse, design MR sequence, 
% configure multiple transmitting and receiving coils, investigate B0 
% in-homogeneity and object motion sensitivity et.al. The main simulation 
% platform combined with these toolboxes can be applied for customizing 
% various virtual MR experiments which can serve as a prior stage for 
% prototyping and testing new MR technique and application.
