% MatrixUser, a multi-dimensional matrix analysis software package
% https://sourceforge.net/projects/matrixuser/
% 
% The MatrixUser is a matrix analysis software package developed under Matlab
% Graphical User Interface Developing Environment (GUIDE). It features 
% functions that are designed and optimized for working with multi-dimensional
% matrix under Matlab. These functions typically includes functions for 
% multi-dimensional matrix display, matrix (image stack) analysis and matrix 
% processing.
